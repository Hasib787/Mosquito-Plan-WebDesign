						not be found on your property contracting mosquito borne illness or
						disease. Customer has been advised of conditions conductive to mosquito
						breeding. This Service Agreement is the only agreement on this

						<h3>CONSUMER INFORMATION SHEET</h3>
						<p>The State Department of Agriculture licenses the businesses, certified applicators and technicians who perform structural pest control work. Certified
applicators and technicians must pass a written examination in order to receive their licenses.<br><br>Pesticides must be registered with the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). EPA registration is not a finding of product safety. Pesticides are
designed to kill or control pests.<br><br>
Your risk of harm depends upon the degree of your exposure and your individual susceptibility.<br><br>

Specific health and safety information varies between pesticides and types of exposures and is available on the label information or MSDS sheet, which can be
supplied to you upon request from the licensed applicator. Take precautions when a treatment has been performed to avoid exposure to vulnerable
individuals. Pesticides may be harmful if swallowed, inhaled, or absorbed through the skin. Avoid breathing dust or spray mist and any unnecessary contact
with treated surfaces. If you desire specific information on precautions, refer to the pesticide label. The law requires that the application procedures specified
on the label be followed.<br><br>

If you have questions about the application, contact the business or person making the application. If you suspect a violation of the law regarding structural
pest control, contact the SPCS. In case of a health emergency, seek immediate medical attention.<br><br>
Pest Control signs must be posted prior to treatment in many instances. The signs should be posted in an area of common access at least 48 hours prior to
treatment. The information sign will allow you to contact someone who can tell you what pesticide is being used.<br><br>

If you are contracting for pest control services due to a home solicitation, you have the right to cancel the contract within 72 hours. You may exercise this right
by notifying the pest control company that you do not wish to receive their service.<br><br>

For general information on pesticides, contact the National Pesticide Information Center 1-800-858-7378.

					<h3>REDUCED IMPACT SERVICE</h3>
					<p>In order to minimize the reliance on pesticides and reduce pest populations, a Reduced Impact Pest Control operator may recommend that you consider the
sanitation or physical alteration of your work place or residence. It is your responsibility to follow those recommendations. Your pest control operator may or
may not offer these services upon request. A proper inspection will provide the information necessary for you to choose the method of pest control which best
suits your situation. Many pest problems can be solved without using pesticides.<br><br>
This Reduced Impact Service will include an inspection report and treatment recommendations. You should review these and keep a copy for your records.
Your cooperation in following the recommendations made by your service provider is essential to a reduced impact service program.<br><br>
Pesticides may be used in a responsible and professional manner in a reduced impact pest control service. If you do not want a specific pesticide used or any
pesticides used at all, you must note this in writing on the contract prior to the initiation of the service. If any specific pesticide or class of pesticides are not
excluded, it may be used by the provider.</p>
